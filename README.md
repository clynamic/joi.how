This is a small application I've been working on for a bit. Just a web app e621 slideshow that has a jack-off-instruction-style stroke-to-the-beat UI! If you find that sort of thing interesting, check it out [here](https://joi.how)!

I'm also taking feature requests! If there's anything you'd like to see added, feel free to [open an issue](/issues) or ask in the [forum thread](https://e621.net/forum_topics/23796).

### Features

- e621 post loader, based on tags.
- Stroke speed and control settings.
- Events that adjust speed, or ask you to do something.
- Duration control.
- Orgasm control.
- Initial support for some basic hypnosis stuff.
- Codes you can use to share your configs!
- Integration with various vibrators through [Intiface](https://intiface.com/) to milk you automatically!

### Usage

Head over to [joi.how](https://joi.how) and try it out!
